        <p>1 There is a $20 per person entry fee. At the end of the challenge, the top team splits $480 and the 2nd place team gets their money back . Yo... That's like some serious Chedda. We talking triple digits.</p>

        <p> 2	Each team completes as many squares as possible in 1 week. It is theoretically possible to complete all squares in a given week (but good luck trying!) Each square counts as 1 point. The team with the most points win. (FYI- there will be some flash challenges available for grabs each week!- keep your eyes glued to those message boards.)</p>

        <p>3	The week runs from Monday-Sunday. All squares must be initialled (once you initial a square you will be rewarded a point) by 10PM EST on Sunday. The scores for the previous week will be locked in each Monday, late entries will not count. Do yourself a favor and do not lose points because of bad bookkeeping. Maybe you will get lucky and land an accountant on your team.</p>

        <p>4	Each square may only be completed once (i.e. 2 team members cannot get credit for the same square.) The person completing the square should enter their initials above the square (see game board.)</p>

        <p>5	Each person may complete more than 1 square in one day; however, each workout can only count for 1 square. For example: if you complete the "100 challenge," this does not also count for the "strength training" square. Example 2: If you run 3 miles, you can count EITHER the 'run 3 miles' square or '30 mins of cardio' square - not both. </p>

        <p>6	The activity in each square must be started and completed within 1 day unless otherwise stated.</p>

        <p>7	There will be a group text including all participants. This group is for updates on Flash Challenges and other 'must know' competition details. You are in no way, shape or form allowed to respond within the group texts. If you have a motherfucking question, text the game master separately. This rule is built for everyone's sanity. Your team will receive a point deduction for every text you place in this group text. NO exceptions.</p>

        <p>8	If a player on your team fails to complete at least two squares in a given week your team will lose 1 point. Sucks to suck, so don't suck. Okay?</p>
